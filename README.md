## General Description

This device seamlessly integrates an onboard Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor for efficient 3D visualization. It captures data across the xy-plane at 11.25-degree intervals, with LED 1 momentarily lighting up upon successful distance measurement before a brief pause for data processing.

Operation is initiated by pressing the microcontroller's reset button and toggling the motor using the onboard PJ1 button, followed by executing a designated Python script. Upon system startup and ToF sensor activation, LEDs 1-4 illuminate, signifying operational readiness.

The sensor transmits data to the board via I2C, which is then relayed to an external PC through UART for real-time processing and visualization. The MSPEXP432E401Y microcontroller orchestrates timing with precision, operating at 96 MHz bus speed.

Distance measurements are calculated by the ToF sensor using the formula: half the photon travel time multiplied by the speed of light.

Data processing and visualization are executed using Python and the Open3D library, transforming polar data into Cartesian coordinates through trigonometric calculations. The processed data is then plotted on a 3D Cartesian axis, offering a comprehensive visualization of the scanned area.
